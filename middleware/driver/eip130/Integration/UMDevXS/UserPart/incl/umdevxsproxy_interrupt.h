 * UMDevXSProxy_Interrupt_WaitWithTimeout
 *
 * This function must be used to wait for an interrupt even to occur. As soon
 * as the interrupt has been reported (by the OS), the function call returns.
 * The timeout value requests a maximum wait duration, in milliseconds.
 *
 * Timeout_ms (input)
 *     Maximum time to wait for the interrupt. If the interrupt does not occur
 *     when this amount of time has elapsed, the function returns and reports
 *     the timeout instead of interrupt occurrence.
 *
 * IntId (input)
 *     Interrupt identifier for which the wait timeout is specified.
 *
 * Return Value
 *     0  Return due to interrupt
 *     1  Return due to timeout
 *    <0  Error code
