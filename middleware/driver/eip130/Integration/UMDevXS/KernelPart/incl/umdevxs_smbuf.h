 * UMDevXS_SMBuf_Register
 *
 * This function must be used to register an "alien" buffer that was allocated
 * somewhere else. The caller guarantees that this buffer can be used for DMA.
 *
 * Size (input)
 *     Size of the buffer to be registered (in bytes).
 *
 * Buffer_p (input)
 *     Pointer to the buffer. This pointer must be valid to use on the host
 *     in the domain of the driver.
 *
 * Alternative_p (input)
 *     Some allocators return two addresses. This parameter can be used to
 *     pass this second address to the driver. The type is pointer to ensure
 *     it is always large enough to hold a system address, also in LP64
 *     architecture. Set to NULL if not used.
 *
 * Handle_p (output)
 *     Pointer to the memory location when the handle will be returned.
 *
 * Return Values
 *     DMABUF_STATUS_OK: Success, Handle_p was written.
 *     DMABUF_ERROR_BAD_ARGUMENT
