 * UMDevXS_Interrupt_Request
 *
 * Request an IRQ handler to be registered for the IRQ of the device managed
 * by this driver. It temporarily unregisters the driver's own IRQ handler.
 * Unregister any handler if a null pointer is passed and restore the driver's
 * own handler
 *
 * Handler_p (input)
 *    Pointer to the interrupt (top half) handler to be registered for the
 *    device. If NULL is passed, restore the driver's own handler.
 *
 * Index (input)
 *    Index of the interrupt for which a handler should be registered.
 *    0 for the first interrupt, 1 for the second, etc.
 *
 * Return: OS IRQ number on success (nonnegative).
 *         -1 on failure.
