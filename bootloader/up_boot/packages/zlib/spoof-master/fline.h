// Read delimited lines from a file, fast. This is more than twice as fast as
// BSD fgetln() or POSIX getline(), as measured on Darwin. fline is written to
// be compatible with the C99 standard, not relying on POSIX or other standards
// outside of C99.

#include <stdio.h>      // FILE, size_t

// Type for an fline state. A pointer to this state is returned or used by all
// of the routines here.
typedef struct fline_s fline_t;

// Return a new fline state, a pointer to the fline_t type. This allocates
// memory for the state and assigns the file 'in' to the state, which must be
// readable. Reading will start at in's current file pointer. fline_start()
// returns NULL if it was not able to allocate memory.
fline_t *fline_start(FILE *in);

// Return a line from state, where lines are separated by '\n' characters. The
// returned line includes the '\n', unless it is the last line in the file, and
// the file doesn't end with a '\n'. fline() returns a pointer to the line, and
// sets *len to the length of the line. If fline() returns non-NULL and *len is
// zero, then the end of the file has been reached, or there was a read error.
// ferror(in) can be used to distinguish between those, as for fread(). After
// that, subsequent calls with state will continue to return zero in *len. The
// file provided to the state is not closed.
//
// The returned line is no longer available when fline() or fline_delim() is
// called with the same state to get the next line, or fline_end() is called to
// release the state.
//
// The line is not a C string, i.e. it is not terminated with a null ('\0')
// character, and may in fact have embedded nulls from the file.
//
// The contents of the line may be modified by the caller, within the bounds of
// what was returned. In the cases that the returned line does not have a
// terminating '\n' or a zero length is returned, the caller may modify the
// byte after the returned line. This allows the caller to always either
// replace the terminating '\n' with a null ('\0'), or append a terminating
// null to the last line without a '\n'. The caller should then also consider
// replacing any embedded nulls in the line with some other byte value, in
// order to assure correct use of the line as a C string.
//
// in's file pointer must not be changed between fline() calls.
//
// If fline() returns NULL, then there was a memory allocation error or a
// size_t overflow. In that case, *len is not set, and the state remains valid.
// If it was a memory allocation error, then the operation can be retried after
// more memory is made available. The largest line length that can be assured
// to be readable by fline() without a size_t overflow is (SIZE_MAX >> 2) + 1.
// If size_t is 32 bits, then the assured limit is a 1 GiB line.
char *fline(fline_t *state, size_t *len);

// fline_delim() does what fline() does, but a delimiter other than '\n' can be
// provided as delim. Calls to fline() and fline_delim(), as well as calls to
// fline_delim() with different delimiters can be mixed, simply changing the
// delimiter searched for on each call.
//
// If delim is not in the range 0..255, then the remainder of the entire file
// is returned. For that case, note the returned line length limit in the
// fline() description above.
char *fline_delim(fline_t *state, size_t *len, int delim);

// Return a pointer to and set *len to the length of the unused contents of the
// buffer in state. This can be used to recover unused data read from the file,
// when done reading lines while still in the middle of the file. The returned
// data remains available under the same conditions as for a returned line.
// This does not change the state.
char *fline_remains(fline_t *state, size_t *len);

// Reuse an fline state, assigning the file 'in'. This clears the state, but
// retains the allocated buffer memory (sans contents) from the previous use.
void fline_reuse(fline_t *state, FILE *in);

// End an fline state, freeing the allocated buffer and the state itself. The
// file that was provided for state is not closed.
