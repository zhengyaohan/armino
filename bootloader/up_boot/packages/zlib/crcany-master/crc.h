/* Run buf[0..len-1] through the CRC described in model.  If buf is NULL, then
   return the initial CRC for this model.  This allows for the calculation of a
   CRC in pieces, but the first call must be with crc equal to the initial
   value for this CRC model.  crc_bitwise() must only be used for model->width
   less than or equal to WORDBITS.  Otherwise use crc_bitwise_dbl().

   This routine and all of the crc routines here can process the data a chunk
   at a time.  For example, this will calculate the CRC of the sequence chunk1,
   chunk2, and chunk3:

      word_t crc;
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, 0, NULL, 0);
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk1, len1);
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk2, len2);
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk3, len3);

   The final value of crc is the CRC of the chunks in sequence.  The first call
   of crc_bitwise() gets the initial CRC value for this model.

   byte-wise calculation of the given CRC model.  The table value is the
   internal CRC register contents after processing the byte.  If not reflected
   and the CRC width is less than 8, then the CRC is pre-shifted left to the
   high end of the low 8 bits so that the incoming byte can be exclusive-ored
   directly into a shifted CRC. */

/* Fill in the tables for a word-wise CRC calculation.  This also fills in the
   byte-wise table since that is needed for the word-wise calculation. The
   second parameter is 1 for little-endian, 0 for big endian. The third
   parameter is the number of bits in a word to use for the tables, which must
   be 32 or 64. The endian request must match the machine being run on for
   crc_wordwise() to work. The endian request can be different than the machine
   being run on when generating code for a different machine.

   The entry in table_word[n][k] is the CRC register contents for the sequence
   of bytes: k followed by n zero bytes.  For non-reflected CRCs, the CRC is
   shifted up to the top of the word.  The CRC is byte-swapped if necessary so
   that the first byte of the CRC to be shifted out is in the same place in the
   word_t as the first byte that comes from memory.

   If model->ref is true and the request is little-endian, then table_word[0]
   is the same as table_byte.  In that case, the two could be combined,
   reducing the total size of the tables.  This is also true if model->ref is
   false, the request is big-endian, and model->width is equal to word bits. */
