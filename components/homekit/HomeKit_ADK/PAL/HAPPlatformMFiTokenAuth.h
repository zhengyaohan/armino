/**

 * \rst
 * Software authentication is an alternative to Hardware-Based authentication which does not require an Apple
 * Authentication Coprocessor. See Provisioning of tokens
 * `Software Authentication <../provisioning_tools.html#provision-a-software-authentication-token>`__
 * for more information
 * \endrst
 *
 *
 * **Expected behavior:**
 *
 * On the accessory, `HAPPlatformMFiTokenAuthLoad` is called during the pairing process for verification of the token
 * that is stored on the accessory. After successful verification, `HAPPlatformMFiTokenAuthUpdate` is called with a new
 * token.
 *
 * A token must be stored persistently, e.g., using a key-value store. Writing and updating a token must happen
 * atomically (i.e., a power failure during a token update must leave the previous token intact). If the token update
 * is asynchronous, communication via BLE / IP must be suspended until the token update is complete. The token can only
 * be used once to activate an accessory. To reactivate the accessory (e.g., after a factory reset), a new token will be
 * issued by the controller that needs to be provisioned on the accessory and used for the next activation.
