/**@file
 * BLE peripheral manager for the Nordic nRF5 SDK.
 *
 * The implementation registers the vendor-specific UUID bases that are used with the SoftDevice.
 * For HomeKit, at least 3 vendor-specific UUID bases are necessary to accommodate:
 * - Apple-defined HomeKit characteristics
 * - Service Instance ID characteristics
 * - Characteristic Instance ID descriptors
 * If additional vendor-specific HomeKit characteristics are present with different UUID bases,
 * those are registered as well by the implementation. Additional memory needs to be allocated by the client.
 *
 * Events from the Nordic BLE stack need to be forwarded to the implementation's function
 * `HAPPlatformBLEPeripheralManagerHandleBLEEvent`.
 *
 * /!\ The implementation does not support concurrent connections or non-HomeKit characteristics at this time.
 * If that functionality is required by the application, the implementation needs to be adjusted.
 * Alternatively, non-HomeKit BLE events may be processed by the client without forwarding them to the implementation.
 *
 * /!\ If the HAPAccessoryServer is stopped the Nordic SoftDevice needs to be restarted.
 * This is necessary because there is no clean way to remove the HomeKit specific GATT attributes at this time.
 *
 * **Example**
