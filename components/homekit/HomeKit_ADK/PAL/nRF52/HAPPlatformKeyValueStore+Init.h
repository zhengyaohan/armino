/**@file
 * Key-value store for the Nordic nRF5 SDK.
 *
 * The implementation uses the FDS library of the nRF5 SDK which guarantees atomicity in case of power-off.
 * Additional CRC checks ensure that corrupted data due to flash errors is properly detected.
 *
 * - Each `HAPPlatformKeyValueStoreDomain` is mapped to an FDS file.
 * - Each `HAPPlatformKeyValueStoreKey` is mapped to an FDS record within an FDS file.
 *
 * Because there are fewer addressable key-value store domains and keys than FDS files and records
 * it is possible for the implementation to coexist with other code that makes use of FDS.
 * The implementation's block of FDS files and records can be selected during initialization.
 *
 * /!\ Data writes and deletions are first scheduled into a temporary buffer before they are persisted to flash.
 * This is necessary because flash operations may take significant time in hardly predictable patterns.
 * If power is lost before all changes have been persisted, pending writes and deletions may be lost.
 * The implementation ensures that writes and deletions occur in the same order in which they have been requested.
 *
 * /!\ If critical data is being written it may be necessary to delay BLE communication until the data is persisted.
 * The `HAPPlatformKeyValueStoreIsBusy` function may be used to query whether there is still pending data.
 *
 * /!\ Before restarting the device (e.g., `sd_nvic_SystemReset`) make sure that pending data has been persisted.
 *
 * **Example**
