 * Wi-Fi manager based on `dnsmasq` and `hostapd`.
 *
 * The following third-party dependencies must be available to run this code without modifications:
 * - ifdown / ifup or dhcpcd: Used to reload the Wi-Fi configuration and joining the configured Wi-Fi network.
 * - wpa_supplicant:          Used to store the Wi-Fi configuration and to provide regulatory domain information.
 *
 * The following assumptions will be made if this code is not modified:
 * - The wpa_supplicant configuration file will be overwritten or deleted by the implementation.
 *   This may affect existing system-wide Wi-Fi configurations that are not managed by this code.
 * - The wpa_supplicant configuration file must be deleted if the Wi-Fi is not configured.
 *
 * **Example**
