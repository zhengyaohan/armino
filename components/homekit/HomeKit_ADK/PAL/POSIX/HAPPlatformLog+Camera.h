 * Log output handlers for the Camera.
 *
 * This is file provides the camera logging subsystem. It is intended to help developers understand
 * the camera input and output streams going in and out of the camera platform.
 *
 * Please note that this subsystem is NOT intended for production environments.
 *
 * Configuration: It is possible to log only a subset of packages:
 *  - Minimal Video RTP data.
 *  - All Video RTP data.
 *  - All Audio RTP data.
 *  - RTCP data.
 *  - Selected packets with statistics.
 *
 * The options are configured in the HAP Platform Log (see @fn HAPPlatformLogCapture).
 *
 * Usage example:

    @code{.c}

    // Log an info-level buffer in the packet logger.
    HAPLogBufferInfo(&cameraLoggerObject, bytes, numBytes, "(%p) log", (const void *) stream);

    @endcode
