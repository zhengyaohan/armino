/**
 * @file
 *
 * The ADK runs in one loop, here called the run loop, and is responsible for managing and dispatching I/O events from
 * all attached event sources, and it also drives the scheduler of timer events. In addition, `HAPPlatformRunLoop`
 * provides a way for scheduling callbacks that will be called from the run loop. It must be safe to call this function
 * from execution contexts other than the main loop, e.g., from another thread, from a signal handler, or an interrupt
 * handler. It is the only synchronization mechanism of the ADK. The remaining ADK functionality, with the exception of
 * the camera protocol stack *HAP-RTP*, executes in a single-threaded way from the run loop.
 *
 * Callbacks are blocking, meaning it is the accessory logicâ€™s responsibility to immediately process them without
 * waiting. This is possible because HAP is essentially a protocol for the remote reading and writing of variables
 * (characteristics), which should not involve lengthy processing on the accessory. I/O in the PAL is generally
 * non-blocking.
 *
 * **Expected behavior:**
 *
 * Function `HAPPlatformRunLoopScheduleCallback` must be called by the accessory logic in order to schedule a callback
 * on the run loop execution context from any other execution context. To minimize resource consumption, it should not
 * be called from code that already executes on the run loop execution context.
 *
 * A HomeKit controller may send a write request for multiple characteristics, e.g., requesting to turn on a light bulb,
 * at *50%* intensity, with blue color. When such a request has been received, all handlers for these characteristics
 * must be called in an uninterrupted sequence, i.e., if there are pending scheduled callbacks or timer callbacks they
 * must be delayed accordingly.
