/**
 * @file
 *
 * HAP expects to have a few KB of mutable persistent memory for its keys and other information. The data is stored as
 * a set of key-value pairs.
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * Several instances of a key-value store must be supported (domains), so that information owned by the accessory, by
 * the SDK provider and by the HAP implementation can be separately managed. The following domains are defined:
 * - `0x00â€“0x3F` is reserved for accessory developers
 * - `0x40-0x7F` is reserved for platform developers
 * - `0x80-0xFF` is reserved for the HAP Library
 *
 * In every domain, keys in the range 0x00 to 0xFF can be used.
 *
 * Note that the function `HAPKeystoreRestoreFactorySettings` only touches domains 0x80 through 0xFF. This means that
 * provisioning information that is stored in the key-value store (domain 0x40 in the POSIX and BLE sample PALs)
 * survives such a factory reset as required by the HAP specification. However, it is up to the platform developer
 * where the provisioning information is stored, it does not have to be in the key-value store. Adjust
 * `HAPPlatformAccessorySetup` if you want to use another backing store for provisioning.
 *
 * Storage of key-value pairs is possible in files or directly on a micro-controller on-chip flash or EEPROM memory.
 * A flash-based implementation of the key-value store may require up to twice as much flash memory compared to what
 * HAP may require. The additional flash memory may be required e.g. because a copy of a flash sector has to be written
 * before deleting the old sector.
 *
 * The maximum theoretical possible capacity of the key-value store is `256 * 256` key-value pairs. The HAP Library owns
 * `128 * 256` of these pairs, the PAL owns `64 * 256` pairs, and the accessory logic also owns `64 * 256` pairs. Note
 * that PAL and accessory logic are not required to use the parts of the key-value store that are defined for them.
 * These parts are merely defined for convenience, and also used in this way in the ADK reference implementations.
 *
 * In practice, only few pairs are used (sparse structure). Actual use depends on parameters like the number of
 * pairings, the given accessory attribute database, IP vs BLE capabilities, etc. It is expected that a total size of
 * `4 KB` is sufficient if the accessory logic does not use the key-value store.
 *
 * Values have different sizes depending on the key; the ones used by HAP Library stay within reasonable bounds
 * (up to `128 bytes` for the longest). In the PAL, there are larger values, for example to store SRP salt and verifier.
 * But PAL code is provided in source form, so these values can be split across multiple keys if necessary.
