/**
 * @file
 *
 * A BLE accessory comes with a BLE stack, which is interfaced through this PAL module. The PAL implementation must wrap
 * the BLE stack functionality for advertising, services, characteristics, and read/write events.
 *
 * **Expected behavior:**
 *
 * The requirements for a BLE stack are as follows:
 * - The BLE stack must allow the HAP Library to handle read and write requests directly. This is required for HomeKit
 * session security. For read requests, the response value and length are dynamically computed on a per-request basis.
 * For write requests, the application must be able to decide whether an error response or a write response is
 * returnÂ­ed. Therefore, the stack must not automatically respond with cached values.
 * - The BLE stack must allow delaying the response to a read or write request by several seconds.
 * - It must be possible to disconnect from the central without responding to a read or write request. It must be
 * possible to immediately disconnect after a read response has been transmitted.
 * - It is recommended that the GATT database size be configurable by the application and that characteristic values be
 * stored in application memory. It is also recommended to store 128-bit UUIDs in a compact format. The same descriptor
 * UUIDs are used for each characteristic and Apple-defined characteristics use 128-bit UUIDs based on a common base
 * UUID (similar to the way 16-bit UUIDs assigned by the Bluetooth SIG operate).
 *
 * To interface with the BLE stack, about a dozen functions must be implemented, for managing device addresses and
 * names, advertisements and connections, and for exposing services, characteristics and descriptors.
