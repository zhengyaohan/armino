 * HomeKit Data Stream dispatcher.
 *

 * Incoming messages are delivered to their corresponding HomeKit Data Stream protocol handlers.
 * Outgoing messages from protocol handlers are multiplexed over the underlying HomeKit Data Stream.
 *
 * An accessory that opts to have its HomeKit Data Streams managed by a HomeKit Data Stream dispatcher must:
 * - Specify kHAPDataStreamDispatcher_DataStreamCallbacks as the HAPAccessory's dataStream.delegate.callbacks.
 * - Specify a HAPDataStreamDispatcher as the HAPAccessory's dataStream.delegate.context.
 * The same HomeKit Data Stream dispatcher may be assigned to multiple accessories.
 *
 * The HomeKit Data Stream dispatcher must be initialized before the HomeKit Accessory Server is started:
 * - For each concurrently supported HomeKit Data Stream memory for a HAPDataStreamDescriptor must be provided.
 * - A list of HAPDataStreamProtocol instances representing supported HomeKit Data Stream protocols must be supplied.
