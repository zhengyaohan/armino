# ARMINO Development Framework

* [中文版](./README_CN.md)

Welcome to Armino!
ARMINO is the AIoT development framework aimed to support Beken SoCs developed since 2022, also it's aimed to support
all popular IoT OS, such as RT-Thread, AliOS, LiteOS etc.

# ARMINO Release and Supported SoCs

The following table shows Armino support of Beken SoCs where ![alt text][developing] and ![alt text][supported]
denote developing status and support, respectively. In developing status the build is not yet enabled and some
crucial parts could be missing(like documentation, datasheet). Please use an Armino release where the desired
SoC is already supported.

==Tag version is the officaial release version, please use the official release version for development.==
